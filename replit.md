# Overview

This project is a comprehensive logistics and order management system built with React, Express, and PostgreSQL. It offers role-based access for various staff (owner, customer service, receptionist, sorter, stock manager, shipping), enabling management of orders, customers, inventory, profits, and delivery tasks. Key features include modern authentication, real-time data, bilingual support (English/Arabic), a responsive UI, streamlined data entry, and a complete shipping/delivery task management system. The system aims to optimize logistics, enhance profit tracking, and improve delivery coordination. It includes advanced features like an owner-only performance report system with key KPIs and a comprehensive LYD currency conversion system tracking per-order exchange rates.

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture

The frontend is a React 18 TypeScript SPA using Wouter for routing, TanStack Query for server state, and Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui for styling. React Hook Form with Zod handles forms, and Vite is used for building. Global state is managed via React Context. The UI/UX emphasizes responsiveness, bilingual support, and streamlined data entry across desktop and mobile.

## Backend Architecture

The backend is an Express.js TypeScript REST API. It uses Passport.js for authentication and role-based access control. PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM handles data persistence and session management. API endpoints are feature-organized with Zod for request validation.

## Data Storage Solutions

PostgreSQL is the primary database, accessed via Drizzle ORM. Neon serverless PostgreSQL provides cloud deployment. The schema is relational, with foreign keys across users, customers, orders, inventory, and shipping rates, utilizing enums for roles/statuses and numeric types for currency.

## Authentication and Authorization Mechanisms

Security involves session-based authentication with Passport.js and bcrypt-hashed passwords. Role-based middleware enforces authorization. Sessions are persistent and stored in PostgreSQL. Both frontend and backend implement route guards for authentication and authorization.

## UI/UX Decisions & Feature Specifications

The system features comprehensive functionality with responsive interface, bilingual support (English/Arabic), and streamlined data entry:
