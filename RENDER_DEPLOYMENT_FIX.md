# How to Fix Your Render Deployment

## Problem Summary

## SOLUTION 1: Fix Database on Render (Do this FIRST)

### Step A: Add Database Migration to Build Command
1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Click your Web Service
3. Go to **Settings** tab
4. Find **Build Command**
5. Change it to:
   ```

## SOLUTION 2: Update Code on Render

Since Git isn't working, you have 2 options:

### Option A: Direct Edit on GitHub
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Navigate to: `client/src/pages/orders.tsx`
3. Click **Edit** (pencil icon)
4. Find line 667 (around line 667):
   ```typescript
   newItems[index].totalPrice = quantity * discountedPrice;
   ```
5. Replace with:
   ```typescript
   newItems[index].totalPrice = quantity * originalPrice;
   ```
6. Find line 670:
   ```typescript
   newItems[index].unitPrice = discountedPrice;
   ```
7. Replace with:
   ```typescript
   newItems[index].unitPrice = originalPrice;
   ```
8. Click **Commit changes**

Render will auto-deploy the fix!

### Option B: Download, Fix, and Re-upload
1. Download project as ZIP from Replit
2. Extract to your computer
3. Delete your GitHub repo
4. Create new GitHub repo
5. Upload the extracted files
6. Connect Render to new repo

## VERIFY IT WORKS

After deploying:
1. Go to your Render app URL
2. Login as owner
3. Try to create a new user
4. Try to create a new order
5. Check that profit = (Original Price - After Discount) Ã— Quantity
